    <h3>How My Crochet Journey Began</h3>
   
     <p>My journey did not exactly start off great. I know what you’re thinking seeing my 
       projects above this text, it seems like I am talented. Well, thank you, but that is hard 
       work and a lot of starting from square one.</p>
  
    <p>So, it first started when my mom all of a sudden started to crochet. The first time I saw   
      it, I didn’t even know what it was, and I had no idea my mother knew such a handy 
      creation. At first, I was not even interested. I just saw it and went about my day but 
      then my sister became interested, and now she crochets as well.</p>

    <p>I watched as my sister made a cool Spider-Man hat, that she later on gifted me. After I 
      had seen that, I could no longer ignore it, which finally led me to asking how I could  
      start.   
      My mom started to explain it to me, and she taught it pretty well, but when I finally   
      practiced it, I hated it, and I didn’t want anything to do with it.</p>
    
    <p>My sister hated the fact that I gave up so easily since I was barely trying. She bashed 
      me for it I didn’t pay any mind to her. The next day, they were still crocheting, but I   
      refused to join them. Eventually, though, I started to pick up the hook and the yarn again 
      because I just couldn’t get my sister’s words out of my head. My sister might be mean, but 
      she is surely right.</p>

    <p>After that, I worked on projects like a mini heart, the bags, a ruffled skirt even, and 
      the Strawberry Shortcake hat even though that tutorial was in Spanish. A headband for me 
      and one for a guy, which, in exchange, got me a ride to school for a week. I even got to 
      sell one of my checkered bags for $40.</p>
   
    <p>Also, when I was crocheting in school, people started to notice. And when I wore my  
      crochet ruffled skirt to school, everybody wanted me to crochet something for them. Back 
      then, I could have made a bunch of money, but unfortunately, I was moving to the 
      Philippines, so I did not have time anymore.</p>

    <p>Well, that is the end of my blog. Thanks for reading, and always remember don’t give up 
      on something just because you suck at it or don’t like it at first, because you never know 
      it might be your passion.</p>
